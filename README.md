## About Me

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Uriel Carrillo, a passionate 19-year-old on a journey to explore and create in the realm of web development. Currently, I'm pursuing my studies in FrontEnd Web Development at the University of Oregon. My curiosity knows no bounds, and I'm excited to expand my horizons to the world of backend development in the near future.

**A Bit About Me:**

- ðŸŽ“ Currently, I'm focusing on honing my skills in FrontEnd Web Development. However, I'm not stopping there; I'm determined to grasp the intricacies of backend development as well.
- ðŸ’¡ I thrive on the thrill of trial and error. I've found that experimentation is a fantastic teacher, even if it means sometimes sharing work that's still a work in progress. Perfection isn't my goalâ€”continuous improvement is.
- ðŸš€ Rapid learning is my superpower. Challenges are opportunities for growth, and I'm always up for tackling them head-on.

I'm stoked to connect with fellow developers, collaborate on exciting projects, and contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of web development. Let's code, learn, and innovate together!

Feel free to reach out to me via CarrilloUriel81@gmail.com to discuss all things web development and beyond. Cheers to coding adventures! ðŸŒŸ
